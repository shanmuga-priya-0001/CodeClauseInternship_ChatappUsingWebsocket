# CodeClauseInternship_ChatappUsingWebsocket

During my first internship, I was tasked with developing a chat application using WebSocket technology. 
The goal was to create a real-time messaging platform that would enable users to communicate seamlessly.
For the backend of the application, I chose to use Node.js with the Express.js framework.
this project was managing real-time data synchronization between multiple clients. 
I implemented features like message broadcasting, private messaging, and chat room creation to make the application user-friendly and interactive.
This involved working extensively with WebSocket events and callbacks to ensure smooth communication.
